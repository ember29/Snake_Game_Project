# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake Game developed using Python and the Turtle library. The objective of the game is to control the snake and collect food to grow in length while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own body.


## Features

- Classic snake game mechanics
- Simple and intuitive controls
- Score tracking

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
2. The goal is to collect food (appearing as dots) to increase the length of the snake.
3. The game ends when the snake hits the wall or its own body.

## Installation

To run this game, you need Python installed. The `turtle` library is part of Python's standard library, so no additional installation is required.

```bash
python main.py
```

## Future Enhancements
